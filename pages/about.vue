    <textBox title="Information On my life And Goals" body="My name is Mathew Borg and Iâ€™m 18 years old. I am currently attending Humber College and I am currently working towards getting an advanced diploma in computer programming & analysis. I was born in Alliston Ontario but I have grown up in Beeton Ontario my whole life. My cultural background is Maltese and Italian. The Strengths and skills I have are my computer programming, web development and skills in small electrical components. These are my areas of strengths because they are some of the things I love working on in my spare time which allows me to be creative and challenge my thinking skills. With these skills I am often faced with challenges and whenever a challenge comes up in my life I will never give up on it and I will work on it until I overcome it. I love challenges because  they force me to come up with different ways to look at situations and push me to learn more information. Life is full of many achievements. These can be as small as learning how to tie our shoes or as big as graduating, getting married, having a rewarding career or having children. To me it is important to set goals that are important to you so you can push yourself to achieve your goals. Some of my most proud achievements are: on June 27 2017 I graduated from Monsignor J.E. Ronan Catholic School, on January 2018 and January 2019 when I was on the science honor roll at Banting Memorial High School, on September 2018 and September 2019 when I received Honor Roll at banting memorial High School for having an overall grade average of over 80% in grade 9 over a 90% grade average in grade 10 and for, helping my FIRST Robotics Team 7200 to win the Autonomous Programing awards at the Georgen and Ryerson events in spring 2019. These are all good achievements as they show progression but I will always look to use my strengths to help make an impact on the world and to better the lives of others. At this point in time one of my biggest goals that I am looking to accomplish is to graduate Banting Memorial High School with an overall grade average of over 80% in grade 12 and to go on to College for Computer Science. Another goal I am looking to accomplish by 2021 is to have started my own development company. I'm sure if I continue my efforts I will be able to accomplish these goals by working hard."/>
