    <textBoxRight title="Welcome To MathewBorg.com" body="This website you are currently visiting has been coded using the nuxt.js framework which was built off of vue.js. This has been done to show my abilities of using html css and custom web frameworks. This site is used to prove that I can use html and other web tools to construct a website. In addition to this I have also done web work using wordpress and php programming. I am currently attending Humber College and I am currently working towards getting an advanced diploma in computer programming & analysis. I was born in Alliston Ontario, but I have grown up in Beeton my whole life. My cultural background is Maltese and Italian. I have many strengths and good qualities but the strengths that I am most proud of are: my computer programming, photography and video editing skills. These are areas of strengths for me because they allow me to be creative while still using critical thinking skills. I love being challenged and coming up with different ways to look at situations while solving challenges. I always make an effort to push myself to work hard so that I can achieve my goals." :image="require(`~/assets/IMG-001-Graffiti Mathew_2021-08-20.jpg`)"/>
